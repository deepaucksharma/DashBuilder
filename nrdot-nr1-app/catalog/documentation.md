# NRDOT Host Process Optimization

## Overview

NRDOT (New Relic Dynamic Optimization for Telemetry) is a powerful solution that reduces your host process telemetry costs by 70%+ while maintaining critical visibility into your infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically identifies and filters out low-value telemetry
- **Real-time Control**: Change optimization profiles with immediate effect
- **Cost Visualization**: See your savings in real-time with intuitive dashboards
- **Anomaly Detection**: Never miss critical issues with built-in anomaly detection
- **A/B Testing**: Safely test optimization strategies with experiment management

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Deploy the NRDOT collector to your hosts
2. **Profile Selection**: Choose your optimization profile (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive, or Emergency)
3. **Monitor Savings**: Watch your costs drop while maintaining critical coverage

## Optimization Profiles

### Conservative (50% reduction)
- Maximum coverage retention
- Minimal risk
- Ideal for production systems

### Balanced (70% reduction)
- Smart filtering based on importance
- Good cost/coverage balance
- Recommended starting point

### Aggressive (85% reduction)
- Focus on critical processes only
- Higher savings
- For cost-conscious teams

### Emergency (95% reduction)
- Bare minimum telemetry
- Maximum cost savings
- Use during budget constraints

## How It Works

NRDOT uses intelligent filtering at the edge to reduce telemetry volume before it reaches New Relic:

1. **Process Classification**: Automatically classifies processes by importance
2. **Dynamic Sampling**: Adjusts sampling rates based on process criticality
3. **Anomaly Preservation**: Always captures anomalous behavior
4. **Real-time Adjustment**: Change profiles without restart

## Best Practices

1. Start with the Balanced profile
2. Monitor coverage metrics for the first week
3. Use experiments to test more aggressive profiles
4. Set up alerts for critical process coverage
5. Review anomaly reports regularly
