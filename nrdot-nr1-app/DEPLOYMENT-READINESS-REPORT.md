# New Relic One Deployment Readiness Report

## Status: ⚠️ REQUIRES FIXES

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Deployment)

#### 1. ❌ Missing Icon File
- **Issue**: `icon.png` referenced in `nr1.json` and `launchers/overview-launcher/nr1.json` but file doesn't exist
- **Fix Required**: Create a 512x512 PNG icon for the app
- **Impact**: Deployment will fail without this file

#### 2. ❌ Console.log Statements
- **Issue**: 45 console.log statements found in production code
- **Fix Required**: Remove or replace with proper logging
- **Files to Check**: `nerdlets/` and `lib/` directories
- **Impact**: May expose sensitive information in production

#### 3. ⚠️ Placeholder URLs in Catalog
- **Issue**: `catalog/config.json` contains placeholder URLs
  - Repository: `https://github.com/your-org/nrdot-nr1-app`
  - Support: `support@your-org.com`
- **Fix Required**: Update with actual URLs
- **Impact**: Users won't be able to access support/docs

### Configuration Review

#### ✅ nr1.json (Root)
```json
{
  "schemaType": "NERDPACK",
  "id": "nrdot-host-process-optimization",
  "displayName": "NRDOT • Host Process Optimization",
  "description": "Turn raw host-process telemetry into cost-efficient insights with 70%+ savings",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "icon": "icon.png" // ❌ FILE MISSING
}
```

#### ✅ Nerdlet Configuration
- **Console Nerdlet**: Properly configured
- **Overview Nerdlet**: Properly configured
- Both have valid `nr1.json` files

#### ✅ Launcher Configuration
- Properly configured with correct rootNerdletId
- Icon reference needs fixing

#### ✅ Package.json
- Has correct nr1 UUID: `7bc3af02-51fa-4ff3-874c-9f3c80985a54`
- Dependencies are appropriate
- No hardcoded API keys found

### Bundle Size Analysis

#### ✅ Bundle Sizes (Excellent)
- Console: 44KB (well under 150KB limit)
- Overview: 20KB (excellent size)
- Total: 64KB

### Security Check

#### ✅ No Hardcoded Secrets
- No API keys found in code
- No license keys exposed
- No hardcoded account IDs

### Compatibility Issues

#### ⚠️ Mock NR1 SDK
- **Issue**: Using mock implementation of NR1 SDK
- **Impact**: Components may not work correctly in production
- **Note**: This is expected until proper NR1 CLI is available

#### ⚠️ Local File References
- **Issue**: Shared components linked via local file path
- **Fix Required**: Components need to be bundled or published to npm
- **Current**: `"@dashbuilder/shared-components": "file:../shared-components"`

### Recommendations Before Deployment

1. **Create Icon File**
   ```bash
   # Create a 512x512 PNG icon with your app logo
   # Save as: nrdot-nr1-app/icon.png
   ```

2. **Remove Console Logs**
   ```bash
   # Find and remove all console.log statements
   grep -r "console\.log" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" nerdlets/ lib/
   ```

3. **Update Catalog URLs**
   - Update repository URL in `catalog/config.json`
   - Update support email/URL
   - Add proper documentation URL

4. **Bundle Shared Components**
   - Option 1: Include shared components in build
   - Option 2: Publish to npm registry
   - Option 3: Copy components into NR1 app

5. **Add Error Boundaries**
   - Wrap main components in error boundaries
   - Provide fallback UI for errors

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Create and add `icon.png` (512x512)
- [ ] Remove all console.log statements
- [ ] Update catalog URLs
- [ ] Bundle or embed shared components
- [ ] Test with actual NR1 SDK (when available)
- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Update version number if needed
- [ ] Run final build and test

### Deployment Commands (When Ready)

```bash
# Validate the nerdpack
nr1 nerdpack:validate

# Build for production
nr1 nerdpack:build

# Publish to New Relic
nr1 nerdpack:publish

# Deploy to your account
nr1 nerdpack:deploy -c [channel]

# Subscribe accounts
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe -c [channel]
```

### Summary

The app is **architecturally ready** for deployment with excellent bundle sizes and proper structure. However, it requires:
1. An icon file (critical)
2. Console.log cleanup (important)
3. URL updates (important)
4. Shared components bundling (critical)

Once these issues are resolved, the app will be ready for deployment to New Relic One.
