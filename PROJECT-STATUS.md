- Metric API (authentication issues)

❌ **Pending**:
- NR1 CLI deployment (tool not available)
- Production deployment validation
- Full end-to-end experiment execution

### Testing and Validation

**Core Test Suite**:
```bash
# Connection and API Testing
npm run test:connection     # Test all New Relic endpoints
npm run test:metrics        # Test metric submission paths
npm run diagnostics         # Quick system health check
npm run diagnostics:all     # Comprehensive diagnostic report

# Component Testing
npm test                    # Run Jest test suite
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage      # Generate coverage report

# Experiment Testing
npm run experiment:quick    # 5-minute comparison test
npm run experiment:run cost-optimization-basic
npm run experiment:results  # View latest results
```

**Current Test Results**:
- ✅ Insights Query API: Working
- ⚠️ NerdGraph API: Requires User API Key
- ❌ OTLP Endpoint: 403 errors (authentication)
- ❌ Metric API: 403 errors (authentication)
- ✅ Component Tests: 19/22 passing (86%)
- ✅ Build Tests: All passing

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Authentication Errors (403)
```bash
# Verify all API keys are set
env | grep NEW_RELIC

# Test each endpoint individually
npm run test:connection

# Check License Key format (should be 40 chars)
echo $NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY | wc -c
```

#### 2. No Metrics in New Relic
```bash
# Run comprehensive diagnostics
npm run diagnostics:all

# Check collector health
curl http://localhost:13133/health

# View collector metrics
curl http://localhost:8889/metrics | grep otelcol

# Check for errors in logs
docker logs nrdot-collector 2>&1 | grep -i error
```

#### 3. Container Launch Failures
```bash
# Check Docker resources
docker system df
docker system prune -a

# Verify compose file
docker-compose config

# Start with verbose logging
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker-compose up --build
```

#### 4. Component Build Issues
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build:all

# Check for version conflicts
npm ls
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```bash
# Set debug environment
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
export OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Run with debug output
DEBUG=* npm run start
```
