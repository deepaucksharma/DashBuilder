NRDOT Deployment Status Summary
==============================

Current Status:
- ✓ All 5 NRDOT collectors are running as Docker containers
- ✓ License Key format is correct (ends with NRAL)
- ✗ Getting 403 Permission Denied errors when sending metrics

Running Containers:
- nrdot-vm-1: Ports 4317-4318 (gRPC/HTTP)
- nrdot-vm-2: Ports 4323-4324 (gRPC/HTTP)  
- nrdot-vm-3: Ports 4319-4320 (gRPC/HTTP)
- nrdot-vm-4: Ports 4325-4326 (gRPC/HTTP)
- nrdot-vm-5: Ports 4321-4322 (gRPC/HTTP)

Troubleshooting Steps:
1. The License Key (a73002b4f9516df7b8696aea5c13681d6308NRAL) returns 200 for traces endpoint
2. However, metrics endpoint returns 403 Permission Denied

Possible Issues:
1. License Key may not have permissions for metrics ingestion
2. Account may need specific permissions enabled
3. License Key might be for a different account/region

Next Steps:
1. Verify the License Key is from the correct New Relic account
2. Check if the account has OTLP metrics ingestion enabled
3. Try creating a new License Key specifically for NRDOT
4. Contact New Relic support if the issue persists
