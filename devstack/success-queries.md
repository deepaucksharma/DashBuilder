# ðŸŽ‰ NRDOT SUCCESS - Data is Flowing!

## Confirmed Working:
- âœ… All 5 OpenStack VMs are sending data
- âœ… CPU load average metrics visible
- âœ… Account 3630072 receiving data
- âœ… OpenTelemetry collectors working

## Useful Queries for Your Data:

### 1. See All Available Metrics:
```sql
SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric 
WHERE host.id LIKE 'openstack-vm-%' 
SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 2. CPU Metrics:
```sql
SELECT average(system.cpu.utilization) FROM Metric 
WHERE host.id IN ('openstack-vm-1','openstack-vm-2','openstack-vm-3','openstack-vm-4','openstack-vm-5') 
FACET host.id 
TIMESERIES 
SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 3. Memory Metrics:
```sql
SELECT average(system.memory.usage) FROM Metric 
WHERE host.id LIKE 'openstack-vm-%' 
FACET host.id 
SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 4. All Metrics by Host:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Metric 
WHERE host.id = 'openstack-vm-1' 
SINCE 10 minutes ago 
LIMIT 100
```

### 5. System Load:
```sql
SELECT latest(system.cpu.load_average.1m), 
       latest(system.cpu.load_average.5m), 
       latest(system.cpu.load_average.15m) 
FROM Metric 
WHERE host.id LIKE 'openstack-vm-%' 
FACET host.id 
SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 6. Disk Metrics:
```sql
SELECT average(system.disk.io), 
       average(system.disk.operations) 
FROM Metric 
WHERE host.id LIKE 'openstack-vm-%' 
FACET host.id 
SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 7. Network Metrics:
```sql
SELECT rate(sum(system.network.io), 1 minute) 
FROM Metric 
WHERE host.id LIKE 'openstack-vm-%' 
FACET host.id, direction 
TIMESERIES 
SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 8. Create a Dashboard:
```sql
-- CPU Dashboard Widget
SELECT average(system.cpu.utilization) 
FROM Metric 
WHERE service.name = 'openstack-vm' 
FACET host.id 
TIMESERIES

-- Memory Dashboard Widget  
SELECT average(system.memory.utilization) 
FROM Metric 
WHERE service.name = 'openstack-vm' 
FACET host.id 
TIMESERIES

-- Load Average Widget
SELECT latest(system.cpu.load_average.15m) 
FROM Metric 
WHERE service.name = 'openstack-vm' 
FACET host.id
```

## Infrastructure UI:
Your hosts should now be visible at:
https://one.newrelic.com/infra/hosts?accountId=3630072

## What's Being Collected:
Based on the OpenTelemetry configuration, you're collecting:
- CPU metrics (utilization, load average, time)
- Memory metrics (usage, utilization)
- Disk metrics (io, operations, usage)
- Filesystem metrics (usage, utilization)
- Network metrics (io, packets, errors, drops)
- System load metrics

## Next Steps:
1. **Create Alerts**: Set up alerts for high CPU, memory, or disk usage
2. **Build Dashboards**: Create custom dashboards for your OpenStack environment
3. **Add Custom Attributes**: Enhance with OpenStack-specific metadata
4. **Scale Monitoring**: Apply same pattern to more VMs

## Summary:
All 5 OpenStack VM collectors are successfully sending metrics to New Relic! The initial delay was likely due to:
- Data processing time on New Relic's side
- Initial metric aggregation window
- Cache/indexing delay

Your monitoring infrastructure is now fully operational! ðŸš€
