## EXACT Queries to Find Your Data:

### 1. Most Basic Query (Try this first):
```sql
FROM Metric SELECT count(*) SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 2. Find OpenStack VMs:
```sql
FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE host.name LIKE '%openstack%' SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 3. Check CPU Metrics:
```sql
FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE metricName = 'system.cpu.time' SINCE 30 minutes ago LIMIT 10
```

### 4. Check Memory Metrics:
```sql
FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE metricName = 'system.memory.usage' SINCE 30 minutes ago LIMIT 10
```

### 5. Find by Service Name:
```sql
FROM Metric SELECT uniques(host.name) WHERE service.name = 'openstack-vm' SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 6. See ALL Metrics in Your Account:
```sql
FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 7. Find Hosts:
```sql
FROM Metric SELECT uniques(host.name) SINCE 30 minutes ago
```
