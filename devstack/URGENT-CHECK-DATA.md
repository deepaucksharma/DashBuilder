# ðŸš¨ URGENT: CHECK YOUR DATA NOW!

## Status:
- âœ… All 5 collectors are running
- âœ… Test metrics sent successfully (HTTP 200)
- âœ… No authentication errors
- âœ… Correct US endpoint

## YOUR DATA IS BEING SENT! Try these queries:

### 1. MOST BASIC QUERY:
```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM Metric SINCE 1 hour ago
```

### 2. Find the test metric:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'final.test.metric' SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

### 3. Find ANY service:
```sql
SELECT uniques(service.name) FROM Metric SINCE 1 hour ago
```

### 4. Find OpenStack VMs:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Metric WHERE service.name = 'openstack-vm' SINCE 1 hour ago LIMIT 10
```

### 5. Find by hostname:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Metric WHERE host.name LIKE '%openstack%' SINCE 1 hour ago LIMIT 10
```

3. **All Entities**: https://one.newrelic.com/entity-explorer?accountId=3630072

## CRITICAL CHECKS:
1. Are you logged into account **3630072**?
2. Are you in the **US region** (not EU)?
3. Are you looking at the correct time range (last hour)?

## What's Happening:
- I sent a test metric called `final.test.metric` - it returned HTTP 200
- All 5 OpenTelemetry collectors (otel-vm-1 through 5) are running
- They're collecting CPU, memory, disk metrics every 30 seconds
- Sending to https://otlp.nr-data.net:4318 with your license key

If you STILL don't see data, the issue might be:
1. Account permissions/configuration
2. License key permissions (even though it returns 200)
3. Data processing delay on New Relic side
4. Looking at wrong account/region
