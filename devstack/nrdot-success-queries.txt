QUERIES TO FIND YOUR DATA IN NEW RELIC:
======================================

1. Check if metrics are coming in:
   SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE host.id LIKE 'openstack-vm-%' SINCE 30 minutes ago

2. See all metrics by host:
   SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE host.id IN ('openstack-vm-1','openstack-vm-2','openstack-vm-3','openstack-vm-4','openstack-vm-5') SINCE 30 minutes ago FACET host.id

3. Check CPU metrics:
   SELECT average(system.cpu.utilization) FROM Metric WHERE host.id LIKE 'openstack-vm-%' FACET host.id TIMESERIES SINCE 30 minutes ago

4. Check memory metrics:
   SELECT average(system.memory.utilization) FROM Metric WHERE host.id LIKE 'openstack-vm-%' FACET host.id SINCE 30 minutes ago

5. See all metric names:
   SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric WHERE host.id LIKE 'openstack-vm-%' SINCE 30 minutes ago

6. Check by service name:
   SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE service.name = 'openstack-vm' SINCE 30 minutes ago FACET host.id

7. Check by environment:
   SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' AND service.name = 'openstack-vm' SINCE 30 minutes ago
