# NRDOT Experiment Framework Summary

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive experiment framework that allows systematic comparison of NRDOT configurations through controlled Docker-based testing. This is the core purpose of the DashBuilder project.

## What Was Built

### 1. Experiment Configuration Schema (`/experiments/config/experiment-schema.yaml`)
- Defines structure for experiments including:
  - Container configurations (control vs test groups)
  - Metrics to collect (telemetry volume, costs, coverage)
  - Success criteria and goals
  - Workload generation settings
  - Comparison dimensions

### 2. Experiment Orchestrator (`/experiments/orchestrator/experiment-orchestrator.js`)
- Complete experiment lifecycle management:
  - **Setup Phase**: Launch Docker containers with specific configs
  - **Warmup Phase**: Allow systems to stabilize
  - **Test Phase**: Collect metrics at regular intervals
  - **Cooldown Phase**: Ensure data completeness
  - **Analysis Phase**: Compare results and generate insights
  - **Cleanup Phase**: Remove containers and save results
- Event-driven architecture for monitoring progress
- Automated metric collection via New Relic APIs
- Statistical analysis and recommendation generation

### 3. Pre-defined Experiment Profiles
- **cost-optimization-basic.yaml**: 10-minute quick test for cost/coverage balance
- **performance-impact.yaml**: 30-minute test measuring resource usage impact
- **scale-test.yaml**: 60-minute production-scale validation

### 4. CLI Integration (`/scripts/src/commands/experiment.js`)
- Full command-line interface for experiment management:
  ```bash
  experiment list       # List available profiles
  experiment run        # Run an experiment
  experiment create     # Create custom experiment
  experiment results    # View results
  experiment compare    # Compare multiple experiments
  experiment status     # Check running experiments
  experiment stop       # Stop experiments
  ```

### 5. Docker Compose Setup (`docker-compose.experiments.yml`)
- Specialized compose file for experiments
- Includes Prometheus and Grafana for metrics
- Workload generator service
- Network isolation for clean testing

### 6. Easy Runner Script (`run-experiment.sh`)
- Interactive experiment runner with:
  - Prerequisites checking
  - Docker image building
  - Menu-based profile selection
  - Results visualization
  - Next steps guidance

### 7. NPM Scripts for Quick Access
```json
"experiment:list": "cd scripts && npm run cli -- experiment list",
"experiment:run": "cd scripts && npm run cli -- experiment run",
"experiment:quick": "cd scripts && npm run cli -- experiment run cost-optimization-basic --duration 5"
```

## How It Works

### Running an Experiment

1. **Quick Start**:
   ```bash
   ./run-experiment.sh
   ```

2. **Direct Execution**:
   ```bash
   npm run experiment:run cost-optimization-basic
   ```

3. **Custom Duration**:
   ```bash
   npm run experiment:run scale-test -- --duration 120
   ```

### Experiment Flow

1. **Container Launch**
   - Control: Standard NRDOT configuration
   - Test Groups: NRDOT with optimization profiles (conservative, balanced, aggressive)

2. **Metrics Collection**
   - Telemetry volume (bytes sent)
   - Process count (unique processes monitored)
   - Estimated costs (hourly/monthly)
   - Resource usage (CPU, memory)
   - Coverage metrics (critical processes)

3. **Analysis**
   - Percentage reduction in telemetry volume
   - Cost savings calculations
   - Coverage maintenance verification
   - Resource overhead assessment

4. **Results**
   - Markdown report with recommendations
   - JSON data for programmatic access
   - Comparison tables and insights

## Key Features

### 1. Systematic Comparison
- Side-by-side evaluation of configurations
- Statistical analysis of results
- Automated recommendation generation

### 2. Realistic Testing
- Synthetic workload generation
- Production-like process distributions
- Stress testing capabilities

### 3. Comprehensive Metrics
- Cost analysis (telemetry charges)
- Performance impact (CPU/memory)
- Coverage validation (process monitoring)
- Data reduction effectiveness

### 4. Easy to Use
- Pre-configured profiles for common scenarios
- Interactive runner script
- Clear results and recommendations

## Example Results

```
ðŸ§ª Experiment Results: cost-opt-basic

Configuration    Cost Change    Data Reduction    Coverage
conservative     -28.5%         -31.2%           98.2%
aggressive       -67.3%         -71.8%           92.5%

ðŸ’¡ Recommendations:
â€¢ Deploy conservative configuration
  Achieves 28.5% cost reduction while maintaining coverage
```

## Configuration Profiles Explained

### Conservative
- Filters only low-importance processes
- Maintains high coverage (95%+)
- Expected: 20-30% cost reduction

### Balanced
- Moderate filtering thresholds
- Good cost/coverage balance
- Expected: 40-50% cost reduction

### Aggressive
- Strict filtering criteria
- Maximum cost savings
- Expected: 60-70% cost reduction

## Next Steps

1. **Run Your First Experiment**:
   ```bash
   npm run experiment:quick
   ```

2. **Create Custom Profile**:
   ```bash
   npm run experiment:create my-test -- --configs "conservative,aggressive"
   ```

3. **Compare Results**:
   ```bash
   npm run experiment:compare exp-001 exp-002
   ```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Isolated Testing**: Each configuration runs in its own container
2. **Reproducible Results**: Consistent test environment
3. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Metrics-based configuration selection
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Test before production deployment

This framework enables data-driven optimization of NRDOT configurations, ensuring you achieve maximum cost savings while maintaining critical process visibility.
