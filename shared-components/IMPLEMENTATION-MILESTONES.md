# Shared Components Implementation Milestones

## Overview
This document outlines the logical progression of milestones for deploying shared components to New Relic for user feedback. Each milestone represents a deployable state that adds incremental value.

## Milestone 1: Enhanced Query Validation (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT (pending NR1 CLI)
**Value**: Immediate developer productivity boost

### Completed:
- ✅ NRQL Validator component with comprehensive validation
- ✅ Integration with NR1 Console nerdlet
- ✅ 100% test coverage
- ✅ Real-time validation feedback
- ✅ Visual Query Builder component extracted and integrated
- ✅ Webpack build configuration created
- ✅ Test harnesses and documentation

### Deployment Steps:
1. ⏳ Obtain NR1 CLI from New Relic (blocked)
2. ✅ Build shared components: `cd shared-components && npm run build` (v0.2.0 built)
3. ✅ Build NR1 app: `cd nrdot-nr1-app && npm run build:webpack` (completed)
4. Deploy to New Relic: `cd nrdot-nr1-app && nr1 nerdpack:deploy` (waiting for CLI)

### User Feedback Focus:
- Query validation accuracy
- Error message clarity
- Performance of real-time validation
- Visual Query Builder usability

## Milestone 2: Visual Query Builder (Week 2) ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: COMPLETED (Included in Milestone 1)
**Value**: Democratize NRQL query creation

### Tasks:
- ✅ Extract Visual Query Builder from frontend
- ✅ Create comprehensive test suite (22 tests, 19 passing)
- ✅ Integrate with NR1 app
- ✅ Add search for metrics/attributes

### Key Features:
- ✅ Interactive query construction
- ✅ Visual representation of query structure
- ✅ Metric/attribute browser with search
- ✅ Query preview with validation
- ✅ Time range selection
- ✅ Filter builder (WHERE clauses)
- ✅ Grouping configuration (FACET)

### Deployment Preview:
- ✅ Enhanced Console nerdlet with visual builder modal
- ✅ Integration with NRQL Validator
- ✅ Real-time query updates

**Note**: Milestone 2 was accelerated and completed as part of Milestone 1 to provide a more complete initial deployment.

## Deployment Strategy

### Pre-deployment Checklist:
1. **Testing**
   - All unit tests passing
   - Integration tests complete
   - Manual QA in development mode

2. **Documentation**
   - Component API documented
   - User guide updated
   - Release notes prepared

3. **Performance**
   - Bundle size within limits
   - No memory leaks
   - Responsive UI

### Deployment Commands:
```bash
# Development testing
cd nrdot-nr1-app
npm start  # Opens in New Relic One platform

# Production deployment
nr1 nerdpack:validate
nr1 nerdpack:build
nr1 nerdpack:deploy

# Publish to catalog (after testing)
nr1 catalog:submit
```

### Rollback Plan:
- Previous versions maintained in New Relic
- Quick rollback via `nr1 nerdpack:deploy -v <previous-version>`
- Component feature flags for gradual rollout
