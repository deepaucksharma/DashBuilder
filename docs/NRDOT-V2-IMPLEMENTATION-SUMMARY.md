# NRDOT v2 Implementation Summary - Bridging the Gaps

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive review and fixes applied to the NRDOT v2 system to bridge gaps between telemetry collection, optimization, and observability in New Relic.

## Key Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Configuration Issues**

**Problems:**
- Nested `${file:...}` references not supported by OpenTelemetry collector
- Missing CPU utilization calculation (only had cumulative metrics)
- No proper OS detection for process classification
- Missing attribute promotion for NRQL queries

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated `config.yaml` to use environment variables instead of nested file references
- Added `metricstransform/cpu_rate` processor to convert cumulative CPU time to utilization percentage
- Added OS detection in `resourcedetection` processor
- Added `attributes/promote` processor to promote attributes from datapoint to resource level

### 2. **Control Loop Issues**

**Problems:**
- Dependency on `bc` command not available on all systems
- Metric names didn't match collector output
- Reference to non-existent "emergency" profile
- No integration with environment variables

**Fixes Applied:**
- Used `awk` for all float calculations
- Updated metric names to match actual collector output
- Removed "emergency" profile references (use "aggressive" instead)
- Created environment variable based configuration in `/etc/default/nrdot-plus`

### 3. **EWMA and State Management**

**Problems:**
- Unbounded cache growth leading to memory leaks
- No TTL on cached EWMA values
- Cache keys not properly cleaned up

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added TTL-based cache cleanup (5 minutes)
- Added observation count tracking for cold-start suppression
- Proper cache key management with process identifiers

### 4. **Cost Calculation**

**Problems:**
- Incorrect cost formula
- No consideration for collection interval
- Missing cardinality multipliers

**Fixes Applied:**
- Corrected formula: `datapoints_per_hour * cost_per_datapoint`
- Added collection interval consideration (60s = 60 datapoints/hour)
- Added cardinality multipliers for high-cardinality metrics

### 5. **New Relic Integration**

**Problems:**
- NR1 app used incorrect metric names
- Missing process classification in queries
- Incorrect cost calculations in UI

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated all NRQL queries to use correct metric names
- Changed from `process.importance` to `process.classification` faceting
- Fixed cost calculation logic in the React hooks

### 6. **Self-Observability Gaps**

**Missing Metrics Added:**
- `nrdot.process.count` - Total processes by classification
- `nrdot.process.coverage` - Coverage percentage calculation
- `nrdot.estimated.cost.hourly` - Accurate hourly cost estimation
- Control loop decision metrics

## Complete System Flow

### 1. **Telemetry Collection**
```
Host Metrics Receiver → Process Discovery → Scoring → Filtering → Export
```

### 2. **Optimization Pipeline**
```yaml
processors:
  1. memory_limiter        # Protect against OOM
  2. resourcedetection     # Add cloud/OS metadata
  3. metricstransform/cpu_rate  # Calculate utilization
  4. transform/scoring     # Classify processes
  5. metricstransform/ewma # Anomaly detection
  6. attributes/promote    # For NRQL queries
  7. filter/optimization   # Profile-based filtering
  8. batch                 # Efficient export
```

### 3. **Control Loop Decision Flow**
```
Metrics Collection → Threshold Evaluation → Profile Decision → Environment Update → Collector Reload
```

### 4. **Profile Management**
- **Conservative**: Min importance 0.2, CPU > 5%, Memory > 50MB
- **Balanced**: Min importance 0.5, CPU > 10%, Memory > 100MB  
- **Aggressive**: Min importance 0.7, CPU > 20%, Memory > 200MB

## Environment Variables

The system now uses environment variables for dynamic configuration:

```bash
# Profile thresholds
NRDOT_MIN_IMPORTANCE="0.5"
NRDOT_CPU_THRESHOLD="10.0"
NRDOT_MEMORY_THRESHOLD_MB="100"

# Control loop settings
NRDOT_TARGET_SERIES="5000"
NRDOT_MAX_SERIES="10000"
NRDOT_MIN_COVERAGE="0.95"
NRDOT_MAX_COST_HOUR="0.10"
```

## Deployment Checklist

1. **Install NRDOT Plus**
   ```bash
   cd distributions/nrdot-plus
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

2. **Configure License Key**
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/default/nrdot-plus
   # Set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY
   ```

3. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nrdot-plus
   sudo systemctl start nrdot-plus-control-loop
   ```

4. **Validate Deployment**
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/validate-nrdot-deployment.sh
   ```

5. **Monitor in New Relic**
   - Check ProcessSample events
   - Verify nrdot.* attributes
   - Monitor cost metrics

## Monitoring NRDOT's Health

### Key Metrics to Watch
- `nrdot_process_series_kept` - Active series after filtering
- `nrdot_process_coverage` - Coverage of critical processes
- `nrdot.estimated.cost.hourly` - Hourly cost estimate
- `otelcol_processor_refused_metric_points` - Filtering effectiveness

### NRQL Queries

**Cost Tracking:**
```sql
SELECT sum(nrdot.estimated.cost.hourly) as 'Hourly Cost'
FROM ProcessSample 
WHERE nrdot.version IS NOT NULL
SINCE 1 hour ago
```

**Coverage Monitoring:**
```sql
SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE process.importance >= 0.9) as 'Critical Coverage'
FROM ProcessSample
WHERE nrdot.version IS NOT NULL
FACET process.classification
```

**Profile Changes:**
```sql
SELECT count(*) 
FROM Log 
WHERE message LIKE 'NRDOT Profile Change%'
SINCE 1 day ago
TIMESERIES
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No metrics in New Relic
1. Check license key: `grep NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY /etc/default/nrdot-plus`
2. Check exporter: `curl -s localhost:8888/metrics | grep exporter_sent`
3. Check logs: `journalctl -u nrdot-plus -n 100 | grep ERROR`

### Issue: High costs
1. Check active profile: `nrdot-plus-ctl profile show`
2. Force aggressive mode: `nrdot-plus-ctl profile set aggressive`
3. Check series count: `nrdot-plus-ctl metrics`

### Issue: Low coverage
1. Switch to conservative: `nrdot-plus-ctl profile set conservative`
2. Check process discovery: `curl -s localhost:8888/metrics | grep nrdot_process_count`
3. Review exclusion patterns in config

## Conclusion

The NRDOT v2 system now provides:
- ✅ Proper telemetry collection with OS-aware classification
- ✅ Dynamic optimization based on real metrics
- ✅ Self-healing control loops with anti-thrashing
- ✅ Accurate cost estimation and tracking
- ✅ Full observability of the optimization system itself
- ✅ Integration with New Relic for monitoring

The gaps have been bridged through careful configuration updates, proper metric calculations, and robust error handling throughout the pipeline.
