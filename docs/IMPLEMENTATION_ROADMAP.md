echo "=== NRDOT POC Optimization Phase ==="

# Start with conservative profile
nrdot-plus-ctl profile set conservative

# Monitor for 48 hours
sleep 172800

# Analyze results
nrdot-plus-ctl metrics json > poc-metrics-conservative.json

# Switch to balanced
nrdot-plus-ctl profile set balanced

# Monitor and compare
