## 🔮 Long-Term Vision

**NRDOT as the "Autopilot for Observability"**

Just as Tesla's Autopilot revolutionized driving, NRDOT will revolutionize observability management:

- **Self-Optimizing**: Continuously improves without human intervention
- **Predictive**: Anticipates issues before they impact costs
- **Adaptive**: Learns from every deployment
- **Transparent**: Full visibility into all decisions
- **Trustworthy**: Safe defaults with human override

The future where observability "just works" at optimal cost - that's the NRDOT vision.
